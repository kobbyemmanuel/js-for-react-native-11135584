### Function: processArray
This function takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled.

### Function: formatArrayStrings
This function takes two arrays as arguments: an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by `processArray`. It modifies each string based on its corresponding number: capitalizing the entire string if the number is even and converting the string to lowercase if the number is odd.

## Task 2
### Function: createUserProfiles
This function takes an array of names and the array of modified names from Task 1. It returns an array of objects, each containing originalName, modifiedName, and id (auto-incremented starting from 1).
